# Vite Project Environment Variables Example

This file serves as a template for setting up environment variables in a Vite project. Vite automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files and makes them available in your application through `import.meta.env`.

To set up your environment variables:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your Vite project.
2. Use this `.env.example` as a reference and copy its contents into your `.env` file.
3. Replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with your specific environment values.

Format for defining environment variables in Vite:
- Each variable must start with `VITE_` (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key`).
- Variables declared in your `.env` file are statically embedded into the client bundle.

Example Variables:
- `VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com`
- `VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key`

How to access environment variables in your application:
- `const API_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY`
- `console.log(API_KEY)

Important Notes:
- The `.env` file is intended for local development and should not be committed to your version control system (like Git) to avoid exposing sensitive information.
- For production, set the environment variables in your production environment setup (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, hosting service settings).
